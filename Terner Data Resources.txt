Add crosswalks - see if someone does that well. Elizabeth wants both guide to cross walks and commonly used crosswalks. Geocorr doesnt go as far enough, but could start with that 


Even how to document lihtc is a good case study for the different data sources.

Attached are two datasets (they are also on box here). Quick overview and feature details of each set: 
* LA Metro and LA Eastern County rental and property data
* 1462 properties 
* Oldest data goes back to 2004, up through present
Rent And Occupancy Data: 
* Occupancy rate (while we have lots of years of this data, typically less than we do of rental costs)
* Historic rental costs (both “actual” and “market”) 
* Historic rental costs per square foot (also both “actual” and “market”)
Property data: 
* Detailed location info
* Property size info (sq ft., acres, #Units)
* Housing Type (e.g., student housing, affordable housing, etc)
* Current occupancy and rent 
Happy to merge, subset etc any of this data, just let me know! Just wanted to see what we had here. 


All of this data was also available for “Bay Area East Bay”, “Bay Area South Bay”, and “Bay Area Peninsula”.


Data Access Note: The method of data access they referenced in the forwarded email does not seem to exist. However, I got the above data by (starting from the home page)  “View All Reports” -> “Data Extracts” -> “Property Data File Export”, and then making a few requests by “Sub Groups” which are basically just neighborhoods. There is a cap at 1000 records per any single request so you need to break up the requests to not get throttled and then concatenate them after the fact. I then set the time to 2004 (earlier than that does seem to contain data), and grabbed both export options “Property Data” and “Rent and Occupancy”.


Other Yardi Data:


The other bulk download option contains the same data as above, but instead grouped by Property Asset Class (E.g., Discretionary, Upper Mid-Range, etc.). 


Financial indicators for their five Bay Area/LA markets:
* Average hourly wage (also broken out by industry)
* Employment composition by industry and number of workers
* Rental market trends
* Occupancy trends
* Data on housing loans
* Data on distressed properties
* Tool that allows you see average costs of whatever kind of unit you filter to (e.g., in x region, of y size, of z building quality what is the average cost of repairs, or management fees etc).
Property Sales data:
* Info on buyer/sellers
* Different measures of cost (total, sq. ft)
* Basic info on property
* Amount of loan used in purchase  
They also have a handful of analyst reports (e.g., analysis of political risk for the housing market).
